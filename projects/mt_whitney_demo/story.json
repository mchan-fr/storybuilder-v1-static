It was so bad that just the day before, hikers were forced to turn around near the summit because of blizzard conditions. It's not what you want to hear right before your own attempt.\n\nThis was an important hike to us. My daughter is named after the mountain, and we'd always hoped to reach the summit together. We trained for months, subjecting ourselves to long hikes on ankle-twisting terrain with heavy packs. But we knew Mother Nature would have the final say.\n\nSo to wake up to this view was promising. Energized, my daughter, son Griffin and I began our ascent to 14,505.",
